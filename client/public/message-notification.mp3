// This is a placeholder for a real MP3 file
// In a real application, this would be an actual audio file
// Download a notification sound from sites like:
// - https://freesound.org/
// - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
// - https://notificationsounds.com/

// For now, we'll set up the functionality assuming this file exists.
// When implementing this app, place a real MP3 file here named message-notification.mp3
